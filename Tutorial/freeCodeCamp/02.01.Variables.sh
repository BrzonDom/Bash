# Variables
#   SYNOPSIS:
#       [variable_name]=[value]
#   DESCRIPTION:
#       You can use variables as in any programming languages. There are no 
#       data types. A variable in bash can contain a number, a character, 
#       a string of characters.

#       You have no need to declare a variable, just assigning a value to 
#       its reference will create it.


# Use [variable_name]=[value] to print my full name 

First_Name=Dominik
Second_Name=Brzon

echo First name: $First_Name
echo Second name: $Second_Name

# Execute:
#   bash 02.01.Variables.sh
